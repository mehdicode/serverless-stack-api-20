# # NOTE: update this with your service name
# The service option is pretty important. We are calling our service the notes-app-api. Serverless Framework creates your stack on AWS using this as the name.
# This means that if you change the name and deploy your project, it will create a completely new project.
service: notes-app-api

# Create an optimized package for our functions
# By default, Serverless Framework creates one large package for all the Lambda functions in your app. 
# Large Lambda function packages can cause longer cold starts. By setting individually: 
# true, we are telling Serverless Framework to create a single package per Lambda function. 
# This in combination with serverless-bundle (and Webpack) will generate optimized packages.
# Note that, thisâ€™ll slow down our builds but the performance benefit is well worth it.
